# Contributing to SIPAIC Specs

Thank you for your interest in the **SIPAIC Specification**.

At this time, **external contributions are not being accepted** into this repository. The specification is tightly coupled with the official SIPAIC software and evolves internally based on project requirements.

---

## Forking for Personal Use

If you find this format useful for your own project, you're encouraged to:

- **Clone or fork** the repository
- Modify the spec to fit your use case
- Extend the format or adapt it to different environments

We recommend clearly versioning any custom or forked spec to avoid confusion with the official format.

---

## Why the Restriction?

This spec is designed for tight integration with the SIPAIC core. To ensure consistency and avoid conflicts across components, changes are maintained by the core team only.

---

## Why We Don't Accept External Contributions

The SIPAIC specification is closely bound to the design, performance, and integrity of the core **SIPAIC service** and its components. Accepting contributions from external parties may introduce inconsistencies, incompatibilities, or design deviations that could:

- Compromise interoperability across official SIPAIC tools
- Disrupt the behavior of internal binary parsers or readers
- Complicate future upgrades and version transitions

For this reason, the specification is managed **internally only**, ensuring the format evolves in sync with the official SIPAIC ecosystem.

If you need to customize the format for a different context, we encourage you to fork the repository and adapt it to your own environment.

## Feedback and Suggestions

While direct contributions aren't accepted, you're welcome to open an issue to:

- Report bugs or inaccuracies in the spec
- Suggest ideas for future improvements
- Ask for clarification on any part of the format
